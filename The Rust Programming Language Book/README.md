# The Rust Programming Language
This projects consists on code snipsets that I used while I was reading [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
> NOTE: Take into consideration that in this project there are my first lines of code written in Rust. Expect conventions (like folder names) to be broken constantly.

A VsCode workspace file is provided which will order each folder following each chapter of the book. The [Rust extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) and the [Better Comments extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) are recommended. The recommendations + settings are integrated into the workspace file.
