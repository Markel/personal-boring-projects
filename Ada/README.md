# Ada
This projects consists on works that I did when I was studying Basic Programming in university.

A VsCode workspace file is provided which will divide everything in folders (although it already is). It also implements most of the commands you'll need for programming in Ada as tasks in VSCode (make sure to have GNAT included in the path). The tasks are Windows exclusive.

For the debugger follow the prerequisites section of https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites (including the C/C++ extension)
